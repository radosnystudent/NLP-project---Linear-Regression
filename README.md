Project for the Natural Language Processing classes conducted by dr Rafał Jaworski on UAM in winter term 2019/2020

Project topic: Good review or bad review?
Description: Create a system that evaluates the verbal review of a hotel, product or book on a scale between 1 and 5 (or any other number).
As a teaching material, collect reviews from a selected service, in which the verbal reviews are marked with a score.
Use linear regression.
The weight of the words in review should be taken as a parameter, calculate them as term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)
